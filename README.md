# Java-Quiz-Application (Feb-2016)
## About
- It is a Java application that evaluates Java skills of the test-taker.
- This was a special project assigned by our instructor to my classmate (Gowtam Potluri) and me during our 4th semester.
- The actual project is to create a simple CUI quiz application. However, we improvised it to GUI to make it more user-friendly.
- We self-taught NetBeans IDE and developed the application using it. Thanks to many online resources(Especially, StackOverFlow) that helped us to crush the bugs and deliver the application for practical usage.

## Features 
- The quiz application launches with a welcome screen that takes user's name as input.
- User name is again displayed at the end of the test with his score.
- The exam consists of 3 sets of 15 questions each.
- Based on his performance , a message is displayed at the end of the test as
  - **For Best Performance:** Well Done!
  - **For Average Performance:** Doing good, practice well.
  - **For Poor Performance:** Never give up! Better luck next time. 
- If application crashes during test or user tries to restart the application, The test resumes from the same state from where the application is closed or crashed(We acheived it using File System that maintains log of the present state).
  
  
_Example_: 
 ```
_________________________________________
| Hey XYZ,                  Score:5     |
|                                       |
| Never give up! Better luck next time. |
|                                       |
| _____________________________________ |

## Important Note:
